                    'Your Tools'is a leader in handy tools for different sectors. Our product line encompasses innovative, high-quality electric, hydraulic and pneumatic tools, which can be divided into four basic categories: metal working tools; concrete and masonry tools; specialty tools; and safety tools.

                    Under the metal working category, our portable magnetic drills provide fast, accurate hole cutting in and out of the shop. We offer the most compact and powerful portable magnetic drills for holes up to 5 diameter. Unique features include variable speeds, multiple gears and reversible motors for tapping and machining. Annular cutters achieve burr-free finished holes, without predrilling or stepdrilling. Our design features precision-ground flutes that provide efficient chip clearance for increased drilling productivity.

                    We also offer professional surface finishing tools and abrasive accessories for grinding, sanding, polishing, deburring and beveling materials ranging from steel, stainless steel and aluminum to rigid plastics and wood. Our line of metal working saws includes portable hacksaws, reciprocating saws and portable band saws. All are designed for the toughest service in industries such as petrochemical, power generation and construction. Rounding out our metalworking line are nibblers, nut runners, drills and drive units and corner drills.

                    As for concrete and masonry tools, 'Your Tools' has the industrys most complete range of lightweight portable diamond core drilling machines and rigs. Enabling fast drilling of reinforced concrete, concrete, brick, block and stone, they are ideal for drilling holes in floors, walls, ceilings and all concrete anchoring systems. Our pneumatic concrete chain saws, with no gas or engine fumes, are the right choice for confined spaces and indoor use. Our hydraulic concrete chain saws are designed for heavy-duty mining, utility, marine and construction applications. We also offer pneumatic cut-off saws for wet or dry cutting of concrete and many other materials. Vacuums and dust extraction tools, portable mixers, hammer drills and spiked rollers complete our concrete tool line.

                    'Your Tools's specialty tools include a full range of tube rolling motors, drills and drive units. We meet the needs of all types of industrial applications with high-torque electric and pneumatic drills, some with multiple gears and variable speeds. Specialty tools such as pneumatic chain saws, air movers, axial fans and ventilators, as well as wood boring air drills for underwater applications, are also available.

                    Finally, we offer a complete line of high-quality non-sparking and non-magnetic safety tools. Special copper alloy safety hand tools are manufactured for use in high-risk areas where a spark could create a disaster. In addition, our reduced sparking diamond grinding discs for speed-controlled angle grinders are ideal for grinding steel, stainless steel and other materials in nuclear plants and oil and gas industries.
